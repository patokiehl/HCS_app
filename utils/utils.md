## Guidelines

- **Utility Functions:** These functions are designed to perform common operations that can be reused throughout your application. They help keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and improve overall maintainability.
- **Modularity:** Ensure that each utility function is focused on a single task to improve reusability and clarity.
- **Organization:** Group related utility functions together, and consider adding documentation comments for clarity and ease of use.

## Examples

- **Formatting:** Functions that format dates, numbers, or strings.
- **Validation:** Functions for checking the validity of data inputs.
- **API Helpers:** Functions that streamline API request construction and response processing.

## Best Practices

- Keep utility functions pure and side-effect-free where possible.
- Write clear, concise, and descriptive function names.
- Include tests to verify the correctness of your utility functions.
